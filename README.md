A red square that converts a decimal to all kinds of different bases.

This is a program I made for fun. To get started, type a decimal number in on the left, 
where it says "number:", and then click a button to convert that number into whatever you clicked.

Say for example if you typed in "10", then clicked on the button that said "binary", it would convert 10 into
binary.

It would also tell you the base number of binary.

There is also a bunch of stuff at the bottom, like links, info, and some bonus stupidity.
